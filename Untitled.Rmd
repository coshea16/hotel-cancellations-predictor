# Problem 1
(a) True
(b) True
(c) True
(d) False
(e) False

# Problem 2
For the majority votes method, the classification would be green because a majority of the models, 3 out of 5, predict that the $P(green|X) > 0.5$ which means that there is a higher probability of the classification being green. For the second method, the classifcation is red because $Mean(P(green|X)) = (0.15 + 0.15 + 0.55 + 0.55 + 0.65) / 5 = 0.41$. The probability of the classification being red is $0.59$ so the probability of the classification being red is higher than it being green.
